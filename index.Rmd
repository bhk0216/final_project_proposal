Influence of Diagnostic Factors on Heart Disease Across Regions

![](cvd.PNG)

## **Introduction**

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally, with various risk factors and disparities in diagnostic accuracy and healthcare access, particularly in low-resource regions.

This project analyzes data from the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) across four regions to assess the associations of clinical indicators with heart disease across regions and demographics.
By developing predictive models tailored to diverse settings, we aim to support early interventions and improve outcomes across varied populations.
