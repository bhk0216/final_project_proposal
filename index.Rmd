Regional and Demographic Variations in Clinical Predictors of Heart Disease

![](cvd.PNG)

## **Introduction**

Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide, influenced by diverse risk factors and disparities in diagnostic accuracy, healthcare access, and regional prevalence patterns. Understanding these variations is critical for tailoring effective interventions.

This project analyzes data from the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) to explore the predictive power of clinical indicators on heart disease across regions and demographics. We aim to identify the most significant predictors of heart disease and their relative contributions to its likelihood.
