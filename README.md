1. Due to an unresolved issue, 
please knit the `modeling.rmd` file again after building the website. 
This step ensures the final website correctly displays the modeling section.

2. The dashboard repository, as shown on the homepage, 
can be accessed here: [Dashboard Repository](https://github.com/ys3875/dashboard1.github.io.git).

3. For simplicity, the proposal is not included on the website 
but is available in our GitHub repository as a GitHub document.

4. Special thanks to Professor Jeff Goldsmith for guiding us through the data science course.
and also to our TA, Ms. Peng Su, for her invaluable assistance with building the website!
