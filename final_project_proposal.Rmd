## Project Title 
The Influence of Diagnostic Attributes on Heart Disease Across Regions (with Varying on Development Levels or Climate Groups?)

## Motivation (Ian)


## Intended Final Products (Yixin)


## Data Sources (Stella)
The Heart Disease datasets were obtained from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository that can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). This directory contains four datasets focused on heart disease diagnosis, each representing a distinct geographic location and with attributes recorded as numeric values. The data was gathered from the following four locations:

    1. Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data)
    2. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data) 
    3. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data) 
    4. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data)

Although the original datasets contain 76 raw attributes, the source provides processed datasets with 14 carefully selected variables that have been widely utilized and cited in numerous research studies. This project will focus on these processed datasets, which include the following attributes:

    1. age: age in years
    2. sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
    3. cp: chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
    4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
    5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
    6. fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
    7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality; 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
    8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
    9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
    10. oldpeak: T depression induced by exercise relative to rest
    11. slope: slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping)
    12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
    13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
    14. num: diagnosis of heart disease (0 = < 50% diameter narrowing; 1 = > 50% diameter narrowing)
    
While our goal is to explore all the variables listed above, some datasets contain a significant amount of missing data for certain attributes. The approach we will take to address these gaps is still under consideration.
    
```{r import data author: Yixin Zheng, Stella Koo, include = FALSE}
save_path <- "./data"

column_names <- c("age", "sex", "cp", "trestbps", "chol", "fbs", 
                  "restecg", "thalach", "exang", "oldpeak", "slope", 
                  "ca", "thal", "num")

process_data <- function(file_path, save_name) {

    data <- read.table(file_path, sep = ",", header = FALSE)
    
    colnames(data) <- column_names
    
    write.csv(data, file.path(save_path, save_name), row.names = FALSE)
}

process_data("./heart+disease/processed.cleveland.data", "cleveland.csv")
process_data("./heart+disease/processed.hungarian.data", "hungarian.csv")
process_data("./heart+disease/processed.va.data", "long_beach_va.csv")
process_data("./heart+disease/processed.switzerland.data", "switzerland.csv")
```

## Planned analyses, Visualizations, Coding Challenges (Thomas, Yonghao)

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    * Graphic Displays: Use histograms, density plots, and box plots to visualize distributions of key variables, such as cholesterol, age, thalach (maximum heart rate), and compare distributions between those with and without heart disease.
    * Correlation Analysis: Create a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between variables and detect multicollinearity, especially for predictors that may be used in regression models.
    
* Linear Regression Model:
    * Model Goal: Assess the relationship between continuous clinical features (e.g., cholesterol, age, trestbps) and heart disease risk scores (or likelihood of heart disease as defined by num).
    * Diagnostics and Assumptions:
        * Check assumptions of linear regression (normality, homoscedasticity, independence) to validate model appropriateness. For example, plot residuals to check for constant variance and use variance inflation factor (VIF) to check for multicollinearity.
        * R-squared Analysis: Evaluate the R-squared and adjusted R-squared values to determine how well the model explains variance in heart disease risk scores.
        * Hypothesis Testing: Perform significance tests on model coefficients to evaluate each predictor's impact on the dependent variable.
        * QQ Plot: Use a QQ plot to visually inspect normality of residuals, which supports the model’s reliability.
* Comparative Approaches:
    * Combining Cleveland and Long Beach Data: Since both datasets are from the U.S., merge these two datasets to assess if a larger combined sample improves model performance compared to analyzing each separately.
    * Model Comparisons: Compare predictive power and variable significance across regions to see if combining datasets yields better insights or predictive accuracy.        
    
* Visualizations
    1. Correlation Heatmap:
      * Variables to Include: Age, cholesterol (chol), resting blood pressure (trestbps), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), ST depression induced by exercise (oldpeak), and number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca).
      * Purpose: This heatmap will help identify the relationships between these key clinical variables, guiding decisions on which variables to include in predictive models and flagging any multicollinearity issues.
    2. Interactive Variables Visualization: 
      Primary Variables:
        * Age vs. Maximum Heart Rate (thalach): Use this to explore how age relates to heart rate, and color points based on heart disease status (num) for additional insight.
        * Age vs. ST Depression (oldpeak): This can reveal if age affects exercise-induced ST depression differently for those with and without heart disease.
        * Purpose: Scatter plots provide an interactive way to explore relationships between continuous variables, making it easier to detect patterns by heart disease status.
    3. QQ Plot and Residual Plots: Diagnostic plots, including a QQ plot, will assess model assumptions. Residual vs. fitted value plots can further validate if linear model assumptions hold.
    4. Histograms or Density Plots for Distribution Insights
        * Variables:Age, Cholesterol (chol), num
        * Purpose: These plots allow you to assess the general distribution of variables and identify any outliers or unusual patterns that could impact model accuracy.
        


    
    
* Coding Challenges:
    * Convert '?' to NaNs, handle missing values through imputation or deletion, and ensure consistency in variable types across datasets, especially if merging Cleveland and Long Beach data.
    * Create age groups, examine exercise-induced angina, and introduce other potential interaction terms (e.g., age and cholesterol) that might enhance model predictive accuracy.
    * Explore different metrics (e.g., R-squared, adjusted R-squared) to compare models across datasets and regions, highlighting which approach (e.g., separate vs. merged datasets) performs best.
    
    * Linear Regression Model 
    * Diagnostics: Check assumptions for linear regression
    * Address hypothesis, R squared value
    * QQ Plot
* Correlation Heatmap
* Interactive Variables
* Exploratory Analysis (Graphic Displays)
 Try different approaches (maybe merge Cleveland and Long Beach, both same country) and check which approach works better.
