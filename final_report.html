<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The Heart Disease datasets were obtained from UC Irvine’s Machine
Learning Repository that can be accessed <a
href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease">here</a>.
This directory contains four datasets focused on heart disease
diagnosis, each representing a distinct geographic location and with
attributes recorded as numeric values. The data was gathered from the
following four locations:</p>
<pre><code>1. Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data)
2. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data) 
3. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data) 
4. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data)</code></pre>
<p>Although the original datasets contain 76 raw attributes, the source
provides processed datasets with 14 carefully selected variables that
have been widely utilized and cited in numerous research studies. This
project will focus on these processed datasets, which include the
following attributes:</p>
<pre><code>1. age: age in years
2. sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. cp: chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs: fasting blood sugar &gt; 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality; 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes&#39; criteria)
8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak: T depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope: slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping)
12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. num: diagnosis of heart disease (0 = &lt; 50% diameter narrowing; 1 = &gt; 50% diameter narrowing)</code></pre>

<h1>Exploratory Analysis</h1>
<div id="data-cleaning-and-preprocessing" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h2>
<p>The first step in the analysis was data cleaning, which involved
handling any missing values across the datasets. After addressing
missing data, descriptive statistics were computed for each variable to
gain an understanding of the data’s distribution. Based on this
analysis, a selection of key variables for further investigation was
made. The final variables chosen for analysis were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age (<code>age</code>)</li>
<li>Resting Blood Pressure (<code>trestbps</code>)</li>
<li>Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (<code>thalach</code>)</li>
<li>Depression Induced by Exercise (<code>oldpeak</code>)</li>
<li>Sex (<code>sex</code>)</li>
<li>Chest Pain Type (<code>cp</code>)</li>
<li>Fasting Blood Sugar (<code>fbs</code>)</li>
<li>Resting Electrocardiographic Results (<code>restecg</code>)</li>
<li>Exercise Induced Angina (<code>exang</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the heart disease status variable (<code>num</code>)
was transformed into a binary format, with 0 indicating no heart disease
and 1 indicating the presence of heart disease. This was done to ensure
consistency across the datasets.</p>
<p>The datasets were merged into a single dataset, and an additional
column indicating the region of the data was introduced. This column
helped streamline the analysis, allowing us to perform regional
comparisons more efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-visualization" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Visualization</h2>
<p>The next step involved visualizing the overall data distribution.
Specifically, <code>age</code> and <code>sex</code> were plotted against
heart disease status (<code>num</code>) to get a general sense of
participant distribution across regions. The initial visualization
revealed that there were significantly more male participants than
female participants. This finding suggested that sex may not be a strong
predictor of heart disease status, and its role in the model should be
carefully considered.</p>
</div>
<div id="variable-categorization" class="section level2">
<h2>Variable Categorization</h2>
<p>Variables were then categorized into continuous and discrete
types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continuous variables:</strong> Age (<code>age</code>),
Resting Blood Pressure (<code>trestbps</code>), Maximum Heart Rate
Achieved (<code>thalach</code>), Depression Induced by Exercise
(<code>oldpeak</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Discrete variables:</strong> Sex (<code>sex</code>), Chest
Pain Type (<code>cp</code>), Fasting Blood Sugar (<code>fbs</code>),
Resting Electrocardiographic Results (<code>restecg</code>), Exercise
Induced Angina (<code>exang</code>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="continuous-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Continuous Variables</h2>
<p>To assess potential multicollinearity, pairwise correlations between
continuous variables were computed per region. The results showed no
signs of multicollinearity, as all correlation coefficients were below
the threshold of 0.7.</p>
<p>Following this, each continuous variable was compared with the heart
disease status (<code>num</code>) using box plots. These visualizations
helped to examine the distribution of continuous variables across the
two categories of heart disease status (0 and 1), providing insight into
potential differences between the groups across the regions.</p>
<p>Key findings emerged from the exploratory data analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>T depression and maximum heart rate exhibit consistent trends across
regions, with clear separation between heart disease statuses, making
them strong predictors.</li>
<li>Resting blood pressure shows significant overlap between groups in
all regions, reducing its standalone predictive power.</li>
<li>Age is a strong predictor in some regions (Cleveland, Hungary) but
weaker in others (Long Beach, Switzerland).</li>
</ul>
<p>Building on these insights, regression analysis was conducted to
further investigate the relationships between the diagnostic attributes
and heart disease status.</p>
</div>
<div id="discrete-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Discrete Variables</h2>
<p>In our EDA, we have explored the correlation of each variables with
num. However, when we incorporate them into our model, we also need to
consider their validity. As a result, although variable slope and thal
have good correlation with num, we still have to drop them because of
their huge amount of missing values. Anyway, to gain a visualization of
each variable with num, we have make some plot which give us a really
clear way of assessing their effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>For cp, which we observed as the most relevant one in our discrete
variables, the asymptomatic chest pain has the most clear effect on
getting heart disease. While for the rest chest pain type, we can hardly
say if they are the complications of the disease.</li>
<li>the variable sex is very uneven in he number of male and female
participants. However, we can still compare the portion of getting heart
disease for male and female respectively, and as we can see from the
graph, all the locations except Switzerland shows clear evidence that
the risk for male of getting the disease is larger than that for female.
For Switzerland, the observations are both close to 1 so we can
attribute this finding to the data limitation, while the final
conclusion remains unchanged.</li>
<li>For both fbs and exang, the result is most straightforward. We can
readily tell that for both gourps in value 1, which means people who
ever experienced fasting blood sugar &gt; 120 mg/dl and Exercise-Induced
Angin, are at higher risk of getting heart disease, making them strong
predators when seeing if someone would have the disease.</li>
<li>As respect to restecg, if we compare normal resting
electrocardiographic results to the rest, we can observe the proportions
of getting heart disease for the rest group appear either around or
above the normal group. Although the effect is weak in predicting, we
can still put this variable into our model to make it more
unbiased.</li>
</ul>
<p>These variables will all be included in subsequent predictive
modeling to improve the accuracy of heart disease diagnosis. The
visualizations corroborate the statistical findings, providing a
comprehensive understanding of how these discrete variables relate to
heart disease across different regions.</p>
</div>

<div id="modelling-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Modelling Analysis</h1>
<div id="linear-regression-and-the-num-variable" class="section level2">
<h2>Linear Regression and the <code>num</code> variable</h2>
<p>Linear regression was conducted to explore the relationships between
diagnostic attributes and heart disease status, with a focus on
regional, gender-specific, and age group variations. Multiple linear
regression (MLR) was prioritized over simple linear regression (SLR) to
capture the complex interplay of multiple predictors. The final models
for these three effects are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Regional effects: <span class="math display">\[ num = \beta_0 +
\beta_1 \cdot \text{trestbps} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{exang} + \beta_3
\cdot \text{region} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{(trestbps*region)} + \beta_5
\cdot \text{(exang*region)} + \epsilon \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Gender-specific effects: <span class="math display">\[ num =
\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{thalach} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{slope} +
\beta_3 \cdot \text{sex} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{thalach*sex} +
\beta_5  \cdot \text{slope*sex} + \epsilon \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Age group effects: <span class="math display">\[ num = \beta_0 +
\beta_1 \cdot \text{thalach} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{slope} + \beta_3
\cdot \text{age_group} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{thalach*age_group}+
\epsilon \]</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The analysis revealed that resting blood pressure
(<code>trestbps</code>) and exercise-induced angina (<code>exang</code>)
are significant predictors of heart disease. Higher resting blood
pressure modestly increases the likelihood of heart disease (p =
0.01027), while the presence of exercise-induced angina shows a strong
positive association (p &lt; 2 × 10^{-16}). Regional differences
significantly impact baseline risk, with Long Beach (p = 0.00439) and
Switzerland (p = 0.02857) exhibiting higher risks compared to Cleveland.
Additionally, the interaction between exercise-induced angina and region
(p = 0.02355) indicates that the effect of angina varies across regions,
with Switzerland showing a notably lower impact (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta = -0.3967\)</span>). However, the
interaction between blood pressure and region was not significant (p =
0.10689), suggesting minimal regional variability in the relationship
between blood pressure and heart disease.</p>
<p>Despite these findings, linear regression is unsuitable for modeling
<code>num</code> because it is a categorical variable, violating the
assumption of a continuous and normally distributed outcome. Residuals
in such a model would deviate significantly from normality, as shown by
a QQ-plot, and heteroscedasticity would arise due to inconsistent
residual variance across predictors. These issues undermine the
reliability of regression coefficients. Logistic regression is more
appropriate for modeling binary outcomes, as it accommodates the
categorical nature of <code>num</code> and provides more robust and
interpretable results.</p>
</div>
<div id="logistic-regression" class="section level2">
<h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>The logistic regression analysis was conducted in three approaches: a
combined model including all data, models separated by region, and
models separated by gender. In the combined model, significant
predictors of heart disease included chest pain type (cp),
exercise-induced angina (exang), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach),
and ST depression (oldpeak). Additionally, patients from Switzerland
showed significantly higher odds of heart disease compared to the
reference region (Cleveland), highlighting a regional effect in the
combined analysis. The region-separated analysis was unsuccessful due to
small sample sizes within each region, leading to unstable estimates and
convergence issues. In the gender-separated analysis, chest pain and
exercise-induced angina showed stronger effects in females compared to
males, suggesting potential gender-specific diagnostic markers.</p>

<div id="variable-selection" class="section level2">
<h2>Variable Selection</h2>
<div id="for-continuous-case" class="section level3">
<h3>For continuous case</h3>
<p>For continuous variables, we use mean and standard deviation (std) to
describe the distribution in overall samples, samples of control(num =
0), and samples of case(num = 1). Then, we use t-test to examine whether
the means of these variables are significantly different between case
group and control group (significance level = 0.05).</p>
</div>
<div id="for-discrete-case" class="section level3">
<h3>For discrete case</h3>
<p>For binary and categorical variables, we use count (n) and percentage
(pct) to describe the distribution in overall samples, samples of
control(num = 0), and samples of case(num = 1). Then, as the data meet
the assumption, we use chi-sq test to examine whether the distribution
of these variables are significantly different between case group and
control group (significance level = 0.05).</p>
<p>Based on the result of both continuous and discrete cases, we can
find that except fbs, the rest of all other binary and categorical
features are significantly different between case and control.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>###Limitation A key limitation of this analysis was the small sample
size, particularly when the data was stratified by region or gender.
This resulted in convergence issues and unstable coefficient estimates
in the logistic regression models, making it difficult to draw reliable
conclusions.</p>
