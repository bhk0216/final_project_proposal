# Motivation

Heart disease continues to be one of the primary causes of death globally, presenting diverse challenges across different regions, each with its unique set of risk factors.
While medical advancements have improved diagnostic methods, there remain significant disparities in healthcare access and diagnostic accuracy, particularly in low-resource regions.
These disparities can be exacerbated by environmental factors, such as climate and lifestyle, as well as varying levels of healthcare infrastructure and socioeconomic conditions.

This project seeks to explore the predictive power of clinical indicators across multiple regions with diverse developmental and environmental backgrounds.
By leveraging datasets from four geographically distinct regions (the U.S., Hungary, and Switzerland) in the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease), we aim to determine whether certain diagnostic features (such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and exercise induced angina) demonstrate stronger associations with heart disease in some regions compared to others.

In the era where data-driven insights are reshaping healthcare, we hope this project could provide accurate predictive models that are adaptable to diverse settings, which can support early intervention and potentially save lives across a wide array of populations and regions.

# Initial Questions

1.  Comparing Diagnostic Factors for Heart Disease Across Regions: explore whether certain diagnostic factors (e.g., cholesterol levels, exercise-induced angina) are more predictive of heart disease in one region compared to others.

2.  Examining Predictive Power of Clinical Indicators for Heart Disease in Diverse Populations: predictive accuracy of clinical indicators (like cholesterol, blood pressure) for heart disease across various demographics.

# Data

The Heart Disease datasets were obtained from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository that can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).
This directory contains four datasets focused on heart disease diagnosis, each representing a distinct geographic location and with attributes recorded as numeric values.
The data was gathered from the following four locations:

```         
1. Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data)
2. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data) 
3. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data) 
4. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data)
```

Although the original datasets contain 76 raw attributes, the source provides processed datasets with 14 carefully selected variables that have been widely utilized and cited in numerous research studies.
This project will focus on these processed datasets, which include the following attributes:

```         
1. age: age in years
2. sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. cp: chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality; 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak: T depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope: slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping)
12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. num: diagnosis of heart disease (0 = < 50% diameter narrowing; 1 = > 50% diameter narrowing)
```

# Exploratory Analysis

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The first step in the analysis was data cleaning, which involved handling any missing values across the datasets.
After addressing missing data, descriptive statistics were computed for each variable to gain an understanding of the dataâ€™s distribution.
Based on this analysis, a selection of key variables for further investigation was made.
The final variables chosen for analysis were:

-   Age (`age`)
-   Resting Blood Pressure (`trestbps`)
-   Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (`thalach`)
-   Depression Induced by Exercise (`oldpeak`)
-   Sex (`sex`)
-   Chest Pain Type (`cp`)
-   Fasting Blood Sugar (`fbs`)
-   Resting Electrocardiographic Results (`restecg`)
-   Exercise Induced Angina (`exang`)

Additionally, the heart disease status variable (`num`) was transformed into a binary format, with 0 indicating no heart disease and 1 indicating the presence of heart disease.
This was done to ensure consistency across the datasets.

The datasets were merged into a single dataset, and an additional column indicating the region of the data was introduced.
This column helped streamline the analysis, allowing us to perform regional comparisons more efficiently.

## Initial Visualization

The next step involved visualizing the overall data distribution.
Specifically, `age` and `sex` were plotted against heart disease status (`num`) to get a general sense of participant distribution across regions.
The initial visualization revealed that there were significantly more male participants than female participants.
This finding suggested that sex may not be a strong predictor of heart disease status, and its role in the model should be carefully considered.

## Variable Categorization

Variables were then categorized into continuous and discrete types:

-   **Continuous variables:** Age (`age`), Resting Blood Pressure (`trestbps`), Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (`thalach`), Depression Induced by Exercise (`oldpeak`)
-   **Discrete variables:** Sex (`sex`), Chest Pain Type (`cp`), Fasting Blood Sugar (`fbs`), Resting Electrocardiographic Results (`restecg`), Exercise Induced Angina (`exang`)

## Continuous Variables

To assess potential multicollinearity, pairwise correlations between continuous variables were computed per region.
The results showed no signs of multicollinearity, as all correlation coefficients were below the threshold of 0.7.

Following this, each continuous variable was compared with the heart disease status (`num`) using box plots.
These visualizations helped to examine the distribution of continuous variables across the two categories of heart disease status (0 and 1), providing insight into potential differences between the groups across the regions.

Key findings emerged from the exploratory data analysis:

-   T depression and maximum heart rate exhibit consistent trends across regions, with clear separation between heart disease statuses, making them strong predictors.
-   Resting blood pressure shows significant overlap between groups in all regions, reducing its standalone predictive power.
-   Age is a strong predictor in some regions (Cleveland, Hungary) but weaker in others (Long Beach, Switzerland).

Building on these insights, regression analysis was conducted to further investigate the relationships between the diagnostic attributes and heart disease status.

## Discrete Variables

In our EDA, we have explored the correlation of each variables with num.
However, when we incorporate them into our model, we also need to consider their validity.
As a result, although variable slope and thal have good correlation with num, we still have to drop them because of their huge amount of missing values.
Anyway, to gain a visualization of each variable with num, we have make some plot which give us a really clear way of assessing their effect.

-   For cp, which we observed as the most relevant one in our discrete variables, the asymptomatic chest pain has the most clear effect on getting heart disease. While for the rest chest pain type, we can hardly say if they are the complications of the disease.
-   the variable sex is very uneven in he number of male and female participants. However, we can still compare the portion of getting heart disease for male and female respectively, and as we can see from the graph, all the locations except Switzerland shows clear evidence that the risk for male of getting the disease is larger than that for female. For Switzerland, the observations are both close to 1 so we can attribute this finding to the data limitation, while the final conclusion remains unchanged.
-   For both fbs and exang, the result is most straightforward. We can readily tell that for both gourps in value 1, which means people who ever experienced fasting blood sugar \> 120 mg/dl and Exercise-Induced Angin, are at higher risk of getting heart disease, making them strong predators when seeing if someone would have the disease.
-   As respect to restecg, if we compare normal resting electrocardiographic results to the rest, we can observe the proportions of getting heart disease for the rest group appear either around or above the normal group. Although the effect is weak in predicting, we can still put this variable into our model to make it more unbiased.

These variables will all be included in subsequent predictive modeling to improve the accuracy of heart disease diagnosis.
The visualizations corroborate the statistical findings, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these discrete variables relate to heart disease across different regions.

# Modelling Analysis

## Linear Regression and the `num` variable

Linear regression was conducted to explore the relationships between diagnostic attributes and heart disease status, with a focus on regional, gender-specific, and age group variations.
Multiple linear regression (MLR) was prioritized over simple linear regression (SLR) to capture the complex interplay of multiple predictors.
The final models for these three effects are as follows:

1.  Regional effects: $$ num = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{trestbps} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{exang} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{region} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{(trestbps*region)} + \beta_5 \cdot \text{(exang*region)} + \epsilon $$

2.  Gender-specific effects: $$ num = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{thalach} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{slope} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{sex} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{thalach*sex} + \beta_5  \cdot \text{slope*sex} + \epsilon $$

3.  Age group effects: $$ num = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{thalach} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{slope} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{age_group} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{thalach*age_group}+ \epsilon $$

The analysis revealed that resting blood pressure (`trestbps`) and exercise-induced angina (`exang`) are significant predictors of heart disease.
Higher resting blood pressure modestly increases the likelihood of heart disease (p = 0.01027), while the presence of exercise-induced angina shows a strong positive association (p \< 2 Ã— 10\^{-16}).
Regional differences significantly impact baseline risk, with Long Beach (p = 0.00439) and Switzerland (p = 0.02857) exhibiting higher risks compared to Cleveland.
Additionally, the interaction between exercise-induced angina and region (p = 0.02355) indicates that the effect of angina varies across regions, with Switzerland showing a notably lower impact ($\beta = -0.3967$).
However, the interaction between blood pressure and region was not significant (p = 0.10689), suggesting minimal regional variability in the relationship between blood pressure and heart disease.

Despite these findings, linear regression is unsuitable for modeling `num` because it is a categorical variable, violating the assumption of a continuous and normally distributed outcome.
Residuals in such a model would deviate significantly from normality, as shown by a QQ-plot, and heteroscedasticity would arise due to inconsistent residual variance across predictors.
These issues undermine the reliability of regression coefficients.
Logistic regression is more appropriate for modeling binary outcomes, as it accommodates the categorical nature of `num` and provides more robust and interpretable results.

## Logistic Regression

The logistic regression analysis was conducted in three approaches: a combined model including all data, models separated by region, and models separated by gender.
In the combined model, significant predictors of heart disease included chest pain type (cp), exercise-induced angina (exang), maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), and ST depression (oldpeak).
Additionally, patients from Switzerland showed significantly higher odds of heart disease compared to the reference region (Cleveland), highlighting a regional effect in the combined analysis.
The region-separated analysis was unsuccessful due to small sample sizes within each region, leading to unstable estimates and convergence issues.
In the gender-separated analysis, chest pain and exercise-induced angina showed stronger effects in females compared to males, suggesting potential gender-specific diagnostic markers.

## Variable Selection

### For continuous case

For continuous variables, we use mean and standard deviation (std) to describe the distribution in overall samples, samples of control(num = 0), and samples of case(num = 1).
Then, we use t-test to examine whether the means of these variables are significantly different between case group and control group (significance level = 0.05).

### For discrete case

For binary and categorical variables, we use count (n) and percentage (pct) to describe the distribution in overall samples, samples of control(num = 0), and samples of case(num = 1).
Then, as the data meet the assumption, we use chi-sq test to examine whether the distribution of these variables are significantly different between case group and control group (significance level = 0.05).

Based on the result of both continuous and discrete cases, we can find that except fbs, the rest of all other binary and categorical features are significantly different between case and control.

# Discussion

This analysis explored the relationships between diagnostic attributes and heart disease status across multiple regions, genders, and age groups, using a combination of exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.
While the findings provide meaningful insights, they also reveal important limitations that should be addressed in future studies.
Chest pain type (cp), maximum heart rate (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), and ST depression (oldpeak) emerged as the most significant predictors of heart disease across all models.

Asymptomatic chest pain was the strongest indicator of heart disease among categorical variables, while lower maximum heart rates and higher ST depression values were strongly associated with heart disease among continuous variables.
Patients from Switzerland exhibited a significantly higher baseline risk of heart disease compared to those from Cleveland, even after adjusting for other predictors.
This regional effect underscores the potential role of demographic and healthcare disparities in diagnostic outcomes.

Gender-separated logistic regression revealed that chest pain type and exercise-induced angina had stronger effects in females, highlighting the importance of gender-specific diagnostic markers in heart disease prediction.
Male participants generally exhibited higher odds of heart disease, consistent with known gender disparities in heart disease prevalence.

The 40-60 age group showed the strongest relationships between key predictors (e.g., maximum heart rate, slope of the ST segment) and heart disease status, possibly reflecting the higher prevalence of heart disease in middle-aged individuals.

The study employed robust exploratory data analysis to understand variable distributions and relationships, guiding the modeling phase effectively.

By utilizing both linear and logistic regression, the analysis captured complex relationships between predictors and heart disease status.
The investigation of regional, gender-specific, and age group variations enriched the findings, providing a nuanced understanding of heart disease diagnostics.

### Limitation 

A key limitation of this analysis was the small sample size, particularly when the data was stratified by region or gender.
This resulted in convergence issues and unstable coefficient estimates in the logistic regression models, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions.
