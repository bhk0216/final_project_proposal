# Data
The Heart Disease datasets were obtained from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository that can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).
This directory contains four datasets focused on heart disease diagnosis, each representing a distinct geographic location and with attributes recorded as numeric values.
The data was gathered from the following four locations:

```
1. Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data)
2. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data) 
3. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data) 
4. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data)
```

Although the original datasets contain 76 raw attributes, the source provides processed datasets with 14 carefully selected variables that have been widely utilized and cited in numerous research studies.
This project will focus on these processed datasets, which include the following attributes:

```
1. age: age in years
2. sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. cp: chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic)
4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality; 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak: T depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope: slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping)
12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. num: diagnosis of heart disease (0 = < 50% diameter narrowing; 1 = > 50% diameter narrowing)
```

# Exploratory Analysis
## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The first step in the analysis was data cleaning, which involved handling any missing values across the datasets. After addressing missing data, descriptive statistics were computed for each variable to gain an understanding of the dataâ€™s distribution. Based on this analysis, a selection of key variables for further investigation was made. The final variables chosen for analysis were:

* Age (`age`)
* Resting Blood Pressure (`trestbps`)
* Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (`thalach`)
* Depression Induced by Exercise (`oldpeak`)
* Sex (`sex`)
* Chest Pain Type (`cp`)
* Fasting Blood Sugar (`fbs`)
* Resting Electrocardiographic Results (`restecg`)
* Exercise Induced Angina (`exang`)

Additionally, the heart disease status variable (`num`) was transformed into a binary format, with 0 indicating no heart disease and 1 indicating the presence of heart disease. This was done to ensure consistency across the datasets.

The datasets were merged into a single dataset, and an additional column indicating the region of the data was introduced. This column helped streamline the analysis, allowing us to perform regional comparisons more efficiently.

## Initial Visualization
The next step involved visualizing the overall data distribution. Specifically, `age` and `sex` were plotted against heart disease status (`num`) to get a general sense of participant distribution across regions. The initial visualization revealed that there were significantly more male participants than female participants. This finding suggested that sex may not be a strong predictor of heart disease status, and its role in the model should be carefully considered.

## Variable Categorization
Variables were then categorized into continuous and discrete types:

* **Continuous variables:** Age (`age`), Resting Blood Pressure (`trestbps`), Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (`thalach`), Depression Induced by Exercise (`oldpeak`)
* **Discrete variables:** Sex (`sex`), Chest Pain Type (`cp`), Fasting Blood Sugar (`fbs`), Resting Electrocardiographic Results (`restecg`), Exercise Induced Angina (`exang`)

## Continuous Variables
To assess potential multicollinearity, pairwise correlations between continuous variables were computed per region. The results showed no signs of multicollinearity, as all correlation coefficients were below the threshold of 0.7. 

Following this, each continuous variable was compared with the heart disease status (`num`) using box plots. These visualizations helped to examine the distribution of continuous variables across the two categories of heart disease status (0 and 1), providing insight into potential differences between the groups across the regions.

Key findings emerged from the exploratory data analysis:

* T depression and maximum heart rate exhibit consistent trends across regions, with clear separation between heart disease statuses, making them strong predictors. 
* Resting blood pressure shows significant overlap between groups in all regions, reducing its standalone predictive power. 
* Age is a strong predictor in some regions (Cleveland, Hungary) but weaker in others (Long Beach, Switzerland).

Building on these insights, regression analysis was conducted to further investigate the relationships between the diagnostic attributes and heart disease status.

## Discrete Variables
In our EDA, we have explored the correlation of each variables with num. However, when we incorporate them into our model, we also need to consider their validity. As a result, although variable slope and thal have good correlation with num, we still have to drop them because of their huge amount of missing values. Anyway, to gain a visualization of each variable with num, we have make some plot which give us a really clear way of assessing their effect. 

* For cp, which we observed as the most relevant one in our discrete variables, the asymptomatic chest pain has the most clear effect on getting heart disease. While for the rest chest pain type, we can hardly say if they are the complications of the disease.
* the variable sex is very uneven in he number of male and female participants. However, we can still compare the portion of getting heart disease for male and female respectively, and as we can see from the graph, all the locations except Switzerland shows clear evidence that the risk for male of getting the disease  is larger than that for female. For Switzerland, the observations are both close to 1 so we can attribute this finding to the data limitation, while the final conclusion remains unchanged.
* For both fbs and exang, the result is most straightforward. We can readily tell that for both gourps in value 1, which means people who ever experienced fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl and Exercise-Induced Angin, are at higher risk of getting heart disease, making them strong predators when seeing if someone would have the disease.
* As respect to restecg, if we compare normal resting electrocardiographic results to the rest, we can observe the proportions of getting heart disease for the rest group appear either around or above the normal group. Although the effect is weak in predicting, we can still put this variable into our model to make it more unbiased.

These variables will all be included in subsequent predictive modeling to improve the accuracy of heart disease diagnosis. The visualizations corroborate the statistical findings, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these discrete variables relate to heart disease across different regions.

# Modelling Analysis

## Variable Selection
### For continuous case
For continuous variables, we use mean and standard deviation (std) to describe the distribution in overall samples, samples of control(num = 0), and samples of case(num = 1). Then, we use t-test to examine whether the means of these variables are significantly different between case group and control group (significance level = 0.05).

### For discrete case
For binary and categorical variables, we use count (n) and percentage (pct) to describe the distribution in overall samples, samples of control(num = 0), and samples of case(num = 1). Then, as the data meet the assumption, we use chi-sq test to examine whether the distribution of these variables are significantly different between case group and control group (significance level = 0.05).

Based on the result of both continuous and discrete cases, we can find that except fbs, the rest of all other binary and categorical features are significantly different between case and control.
